- add telescope binding in cheat sheet too (look at telescope file)
- add tailwind to cheatsheet
cheatsheet: https://github.com/sudormrfbin/cheatsheet.nvim
- add cheatsheet hints

FIX AS YOU GO


cherry picking 

git work trees

- https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/git-worktree.nvim

- Rebasing with lazygit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XaToVut_hs

make the mergetool meld but only use it when you really need to. diffget is sufficient for most cases


figure out lazy.vim
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ahI8lYUYgw&t=181s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28FmViFye2I&t=154s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybUE4D80XSk
- this one shows events on when to lazy load formatters and linters

add debugging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KQK2id3JtI
add labels to debugging windows






UNNEEDED BUT GOOD FEATURES. ADD LATER MAYBE

lualine
https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/11kumh3/what_else_to_put_in_lualine/

add native nvim postman
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLOl8h0jSyk
- probs dont add this since you want to keep nvim as minimal as possible
