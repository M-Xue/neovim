- https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/git-worktree.nvim

- Rebasing with lazygit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XaToVut_hs

make the mergetool meld but only use it when you really need to. diffget is sufficient for most cases


figure out lazy.vim
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ahI8lYUYgw&t=181s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28FmViFye2I&t=154s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybUE4D80XSk
- this one shows events on when to lazy load formatters and linters

add debugging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KQK2id3JtI
add labels to debugging windows






UNNEEDED BUT GOOD FEATURES. ADD LATER MAYBE

lualine
