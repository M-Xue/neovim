add vale, code spell and suggested words to markdown and text files. Also add a markdown linter,




fix vale linter
- vale is currently running on markdown files. However, it still runs when vale is not configured. Change the autocmd in the linter.lua file so that it only runs if it sees the vale config file in the root dir.

Can also specify a custom path to vale config

make the mergetool meld but only use it when you really need to. diffget is sufficient for most cases


figure out lazy.vim

- this one shows events on when to lazy load formatters and linters

add debugging

add labels to debugging windows






UNNEEDED BUT GOOD FEATURES. ADD LATER MAYBE

lualine
