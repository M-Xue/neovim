cmp fixes 
snippets



more cmp fixes
Make cmp popups have a max width of 50
Make the hover and signature help popups have a max width of 50.
- cant figure this out. do it when you meet it later or when you add in rust LSP and look at a really long func
- makue sure the documentation has treesitter??
- make sure snippets have previews showing the snippet
tab goes through the suggestions
enter completes it
if a snippet is open AND a cmp window is open, tab should go down the cmp window 
- once the selection has been made and te cmp window is closes, tab now jumps to the next section of the snippet

fix vale linter
- vale is currently running on markdown files. However, it still runs when vale is not configured. Change the autocmd in the linter.lua file so that it only runs if it sees the vale config file in the root dir.

Can also specify a custom path to vale config
