reconsider keymaps
- think abiout more lsp and formatting information
- moving windows more easily
    - move buffers into new tabs and get better tab navigations 
- learn more about windows, buffers and tabs
- figureout how to move dap windows adn buffers around




:nmap
:nmap <leader>
:verbose nmap <leader>
- shows where the keymap is last called
:Telescope keymaps

add vale, code spell and suggested words to markdown and text files. Also add a markdown linter,




fix vale linter
- vale is currently running on markdown files. However, it still runs when vale is not configured. Change the autocmd in the linter.lua file so that it only runs if it sees the vale config file in the root dir.

Can also specify a custom path to vale config

https://vim.rtorr.com/
- figure out what all operators are and how to use them with other things
https://neovim.io/doc/user/motion.html


<C-w>T to make new tab on current buffer??

fill out cheatsheet
- the cheatsheet should cover stuff not in whichkey and should show the base commands in normal mode like shift k or whatever
- add telescope binding in cheat sheet too (look at telescope file)
- add tailwind to cheatsheet
cheatsheet: https://github.com/sudormrfbin/cheatsheet.nvim
- add cheatsheet hints
- search cheatsheets and learn internsing vim operations
- https://github.com/sudormrfbin/cheatsheet.nvim/blob/master/cheatsheets/cheatsheet-default.txt
- bindings for nvim tree: https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua/blob/master/doc/nvim-tree-lua.txt#L138
