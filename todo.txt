can turn on review mode 
- have there be an indicator in the status line that you are in review mode 
- cheatsheet has comment keymap
- diffview 
    - cheatsheet has go to file keymap 
    - accept both keymap 
    - accept income keymap 
    - accept current keymap
    - next diff keymap

you just need diffview but for pr reviews tbh i think that's it

- currently we only have it for against master?
clean up gitsigns config

see git history on visual selection
see history for line 
see history for file


GIT

- give they keymaps better labels. idk wtf does what
clean up gitsigns config
see git history on visual selection


PR REVIEW
octovim start review -> checkout -> diffview master 
- need keymap for octo pr list "<leader>hO<cr>"
- need keymap for octo checkout "<leader>hc<cr>"
- already have keymap to diff agains a branch "hD"


for lualine: 
- octovim mode 
- lsp
https://github.com/AndreM222/copilot-lualine

clean up git whichkey 
- simplify it. you dont need everything

==================================================

remove a lot of the keymaps and put them into cheatsheet instead
better cheatsheet labelled with the relevant feature

- special icons for special directories like test and git
- more icons here https://docs.astronvim.com/recipes/icons/
- more icons here https://docs.astronvim.com/recipes/icons/
- https://github.com/rachartier/tiny-devicons-auto-colors.nvim maybe good inspo?

Formatting
- If formatting cant help these issues

VIM CHEAT SHEETS 
https://vim.rtorr.com/
- figure out what all operators are and how to use them with other things
https://neovim.io/doc/user/motion.html


<C-w>T to make new tab on current buffer??

fill out cheatsheet
- the cheatsheet should cover stuff not in whichkey and should show the base commands in normal mode like shift k or whatever
- add telescope binding in cheat sheet too (look at telescope file)
- add tailwind to cheatsheet
cheatsheet: https://github.com/sudormrfbin/cheatsheet.nvim
- add cheatsheet hints
- search cheatsheets and learn internsing vim operations
- https://github.com/sudormrfbin/cheatsheet.nvim/blob/master/cheatsheets/cheatsheet-default.txt
- bindings for nvim tree: https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua/blob/master/doc/nvim-tree-lua.txt#L138


multi cursor understanding
figureout multiselect and multicursor
https://github.com/mg979/vim-visual-multi
https://github.com/jake-stewart/multicursor.nvim ??
- can def multi edit line. google it. it just doesnt visually show it. can dl plugin for it i think
multcursor nvim

sed arguments in cheathseeet

Debugger
==================================================
neovim debugging: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyNfnI-B640

add watch expressions in dap
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYzZxi3SSnM

figure out how to move windows (esp for dap)
pulling out windows into tabs and moving them back in
duplicating windows and pulling them back out

add completion for dap : https://github.com/rcarriga/cmp-dap
- for current scope in watch??

figure out all the go.nvim stuff and see what you want/need
need to add watch expressions in debugger

debugger integration in awesome nvim and split up each language debugger settings

fix lsp configs for languages 
- figure out what all these textDocutmer/... and code actions do
- hwo to have better code actions



reconsider keymaps
- think abiout more lsp and formatting information
- moving windows more easily
    - move buffers into new tabs and get better tab navigations 
- learn more about windows, buffers and tabs
- figureout how to move dap windows adn buffers around

:nmap
:nmap <leader>
:verbose nmap <leader>
- shows where the keymap is last called

cherry picking

- https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/git-worktree.nvim

- Rebasing with lazygit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XaToVut_hs

make the mergetool meld but only use it when you really need to. diffget is sufficient for most cases



add debugging
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KQK2id3JtI
add labels to debugging windows






UNNEEDED BUT GOOD FEATURES. ADD LATER MAYBE

lualine
https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/11kumh3/what_else_to_put_in_lualine/

add native nvim postman
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLOl8h0jSyk
- probs dont add this since you want to keep nvim as minimal as possible
